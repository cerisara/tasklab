# tasklab

The goal is to create an android app that displays a TODO list / task list and synchronizes it with a git(lab) server.
This task is commonly done with issue trackers, but issue trackers are definitely too slow to deal with on a mobile: I want
a very fast app where adding or modifying priority of a task is done in just one click.
Furthermore, mobile issue trackers rarely have the nice "board" that separates urgent from long-term or done tasks. This is definitely a desired feature for this task list.
And they are too heavy for what we want to do here.

Because git pull/push is not so easy to do in android, the idea here is to rather rely on a git(lab/hub) api for pulling  and commits.

Ultimately, a companion desktop app or web service should be done afterwards.
